# GameOfLife

## How to Grade / Run
All the code I wrote for the application is in core/src/main/java/com/GameOfLife and in lwjgl3/src/main/java/com/GameOfLife/lwjgl3/Lwjgl3Launcher.java

Everything else is related to the library or build pipeline for libgdx

To run, you can either run a .app bundle, run a .jar, or compile it yourself. I recommend one of the first two for reliability. If you want to compile and run yourself:
  Use the RunDesktop run configuration in .idea/runConfigurations

  OR
  
  Create a new run configuration, choose application
  The main class is in lwjgl3/src/main/java/com/GameOfLife/lwjgl3/Lwjgl3Launcher.java
  Add in the vm arguments -XstartOnFirstThread if you're on mac
  Then run it—Gradle should be preinstalled with intelliJ and be able to use the already-defined gradle stuff to build and run the project.

The compiled .app bundle, which should have a jdk bundled with it, is found in the finalBuild folder. The .app file is secretly a folder, you can look inside it to find the .jar if you want to run that instead
.jar or .app files will have to be from the command line to use program arguments, make sure to use "./" before the name of the executable. Without program arguments, the program chooses a random pattern.
The program can simulate from any of the given patterns (although "Elemtary Knightship" was changed to "elementaryknightship")

It also has different styles, which control how the cells look. You can set the style by passing in -style "style here" from the command line.
The available styles are default, seaLantern, redstone, and moss.

Finally, you can use arrow keys or click-and-drag to pan, and the +/- keys to zoom in or out to get a better look at things.


## Autogenerated from Setup Tool
A [libGDX](https://libgdx.com/) project generated with [gdx-liftoff](https://github.com/libgdx/gdx-liftoff).

This project was generated with a template including simple application launchers and an `ApplicationAdapter` extension that draws libGDX logo.

### Platforms

- `core`: Main module with the application logic shared by all platforms.
- `lwjgl3`: Primary desktop platform using LWJGL3; was called 'desktop' in older docs.

### Gradle

This project uses [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) to manage dependencies.
The Gradle wrapper was included, so you can run Gradle tasks using `gradlew.bat` or `./gradlew` commands.
Useful Gradle tasks and flags:

- `--continue`: when using this flag, errors will not stop the tasks from running.
- `--daemon`: thanks to this flag, Gradle daemon will be used to run chosen tasks.
- `--offline`: when using this flag, cached dependency archives will be used.
- `--refresh-dependencies`: this flag forces validation of all dependencies. Useful for snapshot versions.
- `build`: builds sources and archives of every project.
- `cleanEclipse`: removes Eclipse project data.
- `cleanIdea`: removes IntelliJ project data.
- `clean`: removes `build` folders, which store compiled classes and built archives.
- `eclipse`: generates Eclipse project data.
- `idea`: generates IntelliJ project data.
- `lwjgl3:jar`: builds application's runnable jar, which can be found at `lwjgl3/build/libs`.
- `lwjgl3:run`: starts the application.
- `test`: runs unit tests (if any).

Note that most tasks that are not specific to a single project can be run with `name:` prefix, where the `name` should be replaced with the ID of a specific project.
For example, `core:clean` removes `build` folder only from the `core` project.
